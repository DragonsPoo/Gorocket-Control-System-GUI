# **App Name**: GOREOCKET Control Suite

## Core Features:

- Sensor Data Acquisition: Real-time data display of four pressure transducers (PT), two flow sensors, and one thermocouple (TC).
- Servo Motor Control: Manual control interface for seven servo motors (ball valve actuation) with visual indication of valve state (open/closed).
- Limit Switch Monitoring: Limit switch integration: Display the status of 14 limit switches (2 per servo motor, indicating fully open/closed valve position).
- Control Sequence Activation: Enable execution of predefined control sequences (automated valve control, data logging triggers, etc.) through dedicated GUI buttons.
- Data Visualization: Real-time plotting of sensor data with zoom, pan, and data export functionality.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#2E3148) to convey precision and reliability.
- Background color: Very dark gray (#222225) for high contrast.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF) for highlighting interactive elements and critical data.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif known for its modern, machined look, suitable for a data-intensive interface.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying serial communication or debugging information.
- Divide the GUI into distinct panels for data display, motor control, sequence activation, and limit switch status. Utilize a grid layout for organized element placement.
- Use clear and concise icons to represent valve states, sensor types, and control functions.
